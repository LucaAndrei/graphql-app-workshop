This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goals

1. Learn how to use the basic operations that sustain the GraphQL ecosystem - queries and mutations. To do so, we'll implement a simple login screen using Apollo on our client side React app and Graphcool - a BaaS alternative that will work as a server.
2. Implement the authentication layer - Bonus: Redux & Redux Persist.
3. Use GraphQL Subscriptions to implement a fully functional real-time chat.

### Preparation

To make everything run smoothly, you'll need to clone this repo and make sure you can run the app, on your machine. On Friday, you'll be able to pull all the components necessary to implement the first task. 

**Note: to avoid any problems I recommend forking this repo and cloning your own fork.**
