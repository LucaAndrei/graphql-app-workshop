This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goals

1. Learn how to use the basic operations that sustain the GraphQL ecosystem - queries and mutations. To do so, we'll implement a simple login screen using Apollo on our client side React app and Graphcool - a BaaS alternative that will work as a server.
2. Implement the authentication layer - Bonus: Redux & Redux Persist.
3. Use GraphQL Subscriptions to implement a fully functional real-time chat.

### Preparations

1. To make everything run smoothly, you'll need to clone this repo and make sure you can run the app, on your machine. On Friday, you'll be able to pull all the components necessary to implement the first task. 

**Note: to avoid any problems I recommend forking this repo and cloning your own fork**

2. Go to the [Graphcool Console](http://console.graph.cool/) and make sure that you can login, using you Github account. Since you've already forked & cloned the repo, I assume this would be the easiest way to access the console. You can login using Google as well, or any other method that suits you best.
